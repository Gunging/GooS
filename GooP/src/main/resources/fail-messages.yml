####    When a command fails, this is the message that will be shown to
####    the players it failed for.
####
####        'The players it failed for'
####            Most commands have a <player> argument to specify who to target.
####            These messages will display to those targets that fail.
####
####        To use, begin the subcommand with [#] where # is the fail message name.
####            For example, /goop [DIRT]testinventory %player% mainhand v DIRT 1
####            Will make that, if %player% is not holding dirt, message 5 will appear.

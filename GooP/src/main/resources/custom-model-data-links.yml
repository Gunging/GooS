##  
##  Custom Model Data links, as their name imply, Link an Action to an item by it simply having the correct Custom Model Data.
##  
##  The way to do this is very simple:
##  
##  [Material]:
##    [Custom Model Data]:
##      {Link}: {Value}
##      {Link}: {Value}
##      {Link}: {Value}
##      ...
##  
##  For Example:
##  
##  DIAMOND_SWORD:
##    CMD_1337:
##      AsJSONFurniture: true
##  
##  Will tell GooP to treat diamond swords with a Custom Model Data of '1337' as JSON Blocks.
##    ( Basically will place them on armor stand heads, which in turn will be placed within barrier blocks; Allowing for custom blocks)

# Removing enchantments with the above operation can leave
# villagers selling empty books... which is not a lot of fun
# from the eyes of players.
#
# Use this to switch enchantments to another, assuming you
# are not removing absolutely every enchantment!
#
# Basically, suppose you include SMITE in DeletedEnchantments,
# and here you set UNBREAKING; All instances of SMITE in items
# will be switched to UNBREAKING of the same level.
#
# The levels will never exceed UNBREAKING 3, as this is the vanilla
# maximum.
